This test reports how many\nof these reactions, which transports metabolites from one compartment\nto another, are present in the model, as at least one transport reaction\nmust be present for cells to take up nutrients and/or excrete waste.\n\nImplementation:\nA transport reaction is defined as follows:\n1. It contains metabolites from at least 2 compartments and\n2. at least 1 metabolite undergoes no chemical reaction, i.e.,\nthe formula and/or annotation stays the same on both sides of the equation.\n\nA notable exception is transport via PTS, which also contains the following\nrestriction:\n3. The transported metabolite(s) are transported into a compartment through\nthe exchange of a phosphate.\n\nAn example of transport via PTS would be\npep(c) + glucose(e) -> glucose-6-phosphate(c) + pyr(c)\n\nReactions similar to transport via PTS (referred to as \"modified transport\nreactions\") follow a similar pattern:\nA(x) + B-R(y) -> A-R(y) + B(y)\n\nSuch modified transport reactions can be detected, but only when the\nformula is defined for all metabolites in a particular reaction. If this\nis not the case, transport reactions are identified through annotations,\nwhich cannot detect modified transport reactions.",

      "summary": "The growth-associated maintenance (GAM) term accounts for the energy in\nthe form of ATP that is required to synthesize macromolecules such as\nProteins, DNA and RNA, and other processes during growth. A GAM term is\ntherefore a requirement for any well-defined biomass reaction. There are\ndifferent ways to implement this term depending on\nwhat kind of experimental data is available and the preferred\nway of implementing the biomass reaction:\n- Chemostat growth experiments yield a single GAM value representing the\n  required energy per gram of biomass (Figure 6 of [1]_). This can be\n  implemented in a lumped biomass reaction or in the final term of a split\n  biomass reaction.\n- Experimentally delineating or estimating the GAM requirements\n  for each macromolecule separately is possible, yet requires either\n  data from multi-omics experiments [2]_ or detailed resources [1]_ ,\n  respectively. Individual energy requirements can either be implemented\n  in a split biomass equation on the term for each macromolecule, or, on\n  the basis of the biomass composition, they can be summed into a single\n  GAM value for growth and treated as mentioned above.\n\nThis test is only able to detect if a lumped biomass reaction or the final\nterm of a split biomass reaction contains this term. Hence, it will\nonly detect the use of a single GAM value as opposed to individual energy\nrequirements of each macromolecule. Both approaches, however, have\nits merits.\n\nImplementation:\nDetermines the metabolite identifiers of ATP, ADP, H2O, HO4P and H+ based\non an internal mapping table. Checks if ATP and H2O are a subset of the\nreactants and ADP, HO4P and H+ a subset of the products of the biomass\nreaction.\n\nReferences:\n.. [1] Thiele, I., & Palsson, B. Ø. (2010, January).

Such\n    reactions are conceptual, created solely for modeling purposes, and do not\n    have a physical correspondence. Unlike the analogous demand (SBO:....)\n    reactions, which are usually designated as irreversible, sink reactions\n    always represent a reversible uptake/secretion processes, and act as a\n    metabolite source with no cost to the cell. Sink reactions, also referred\n    to as R_SINK_, are generally used for compounds that are metabolized by\n    the cell but are produced by non-metabolic, un-modeled cellular processes.'\n    Every sink reaction should be annotated with\n    this. Sink reactions differ from exchange reactions in that the metabolites\n    are not removed from the extracellular environment, but from any of the\n    organism's compartments.\n\n    Implementation:\n    Check if each sink reaction has a non-zero \"annotation\"\n    attribute that contains the key \"sbo\" with the associated\n    value being one of the SBO terms above.",
