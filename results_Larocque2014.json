This test\nrequires the presence of metabolite formula to be able to identify\ntransport reactions.

Boundary reactions are identified using the attribute\ncobra.Model.boundary.

It contains metabolites from at least 2 compartments and\n2. at least 1 metabolite undergoes no chemical reaction, i.e.,\nthe formula and/or annotation stays the same on both sides of the equation.\n\nA notable exception is transport via PTS, which also contains the following\nrestriction:\n3. The transported metabolite(s) are transported into a compartment through\nthe exchange of a phosphate.\n\nAn example of transport via PTS would be\npep(c) + glucose(e) -> glucose-6-phosphate(c) + pyr(c)\n\nReactions similar to transport via PTS (referred to as \"modified transport\nreactions\") follow a similar pattern:\nA(x) + B-R(y) -> A-R(y) + B(y)\n\nSuch modified transport reactions can be detected, but only when the\nformula is defined for all metabolites in a particular reaction. If this\nis not the case, transport reactions are identified through annotations,\nwhich cannot detect modified transport reactions.",

      "summary": "The growth-associated maintenance (GAM) term accounts for the energy in\nthe form of ATP that is required to synthesize macromolecules such as\nProteins, DNA and RNA, and other processes during growth. A GAM term is\ntherefore a requirement for any well-defined biomass reaction. There are\ndifferent ways to implement this term depending on\nwhat kind of experimental data is available and the preferred\nway of implementing the biomass reaction:\n- Chemostat growth experiments yield a single GAM value representing the\n  required energy per gram of biomass (Figure 6 of [1]_). This can be\n  implemented in a lumped biomass reaction or in the final term of a split\n  biomass reaction.\n- Experimentally delineating or estimating the GAM requirements\n  for each macromolecule separately is possible, yet requires either\n  data from multi-omics experiments [2]_ or detailed resources [1]_ ,\n  respectively. Individual energy requirements can either be implemented\n  in a split biomass equation on the term for each macromolecule, or, on\n  the basis of the biomass composition, they can be summed into a single\n  GAM value for growth and treated as mentioned above.\n\nThis test is only able to detect if a lumped biomass reaction or the final\nterm of a split biomass reaction contains this term. Hence, it will\nonly detect the use of a single GAM value as opposed to individual energy\nrequirements of each macromolecule. Both approaches, however, have\nits merits.\n\nImplementation:\nDetermines the metabolite identifiers of ATP, ADP, H2O, HO4P and H+ based\non an internal mapping table. Checks if ATP and H2O are a subset of the\nreactants and ADP, HO4P and H+ a subset of the products of the biomass\nreaction.\n\nReferences:\n.. [1] Thiele, I., & Palsson, B. Ø. (2010, January).

This does not only\nfacilitate the use of a model in a broad array of computational pipelines,\nit also promotes the metabolic model itself to become an organism-specific\nknowledge base.\n\nFor this test to pass, each gene annotation should contain\ncross-references to a number of databases. The currently selection is\nlisted in `annotation.py`, but an ongoing discussion can be found at\nhttps://github.com/opencobra/memote/issues/332. For each database this\ntest checks for the presence of its corresponding namespace ID to comply\nwith the MIRIAM guidelines i.e. they have to match those defined on\nhttps://identifiers.org/.\n\nSince each database is quite different and some potentially incomplete, it\nmay not be feasible to achieve 100% coverage for each of them. Generally\nit should be possible, however, to obtain cross-references to at least\none of the databases for all gene products consistently.\n\nImplementation:\nCheck if the keys of the annotation attribute of each cobra.Gene of\nthe model match with a selection of common genome databases.

However,\nin models that lack appropriate annotations, it may hamper the ability of\nother researchers to use it. Running the model through a computational\npipeline may be difficult without first consolidating the namespace.\n\nHence, this test checks if the main metabolite identifiers can be\nattributed to one single namespace based on the regex patterns defined at\nhttps://identifiers.org/\n\nImplementation:\nGenerate a table with each column corresponding to one\ndatabase from the selection and each row to a metabolite identifier. A\nBoolean entry indicates whether the identifier matches the regular\nexpression of the corresponding database. Since the Biocyc pattern matches\nbroadly, we assume that any instance of an identifier matching to Biocyc\nAND any other database pattern is a false positive match for Biocyc and\nthus set it to ``false``. Sum the positive matches for each database and\nassume that the largest set is the 'main' identifier namespace.",

This does not only\nfacilitate the use of a model in a broad array of computational pipelines,\nit also promotes the metabolic model itself to become an organism-specific\nknowledge base.\n\nFor this test to pass, each reaction annotation should contain\ncross-references to a number of databases. The currently selection is\nlisted in `annotation.py`, but an ongoing discussion can be found at\nhttps://github.com/opencobra/memote/issues/332. For each database this\ntest checks for the presence of its corresponding namespace ID to comply\nwith the MIRIAM guidelines i.e. they have to match those defined on\nhttps://identifiers.org/.\n\nSince each database is quite different and some potentially incomplete, it\nmay not be feasible to achieve 100% coverage for each of them. Generally\nit should be possible, however, to obtain cross-references to at least\none of the databases for all reactions consistently.\n\nImplementation:\nCheck if the keys of the annotation attribute of each cobra.Reaction of\nthe model match with a selection of common biochemical databases. The\nannotation  attribute of cobrapy components is a dictionary of\nkey:value pairs.",

Such\n    reactions are conceptual, created solely for modeling purposes, and do not\n    have a physical correspondence. Unlike the analogous demand (SBO:....)\n    reactions, which are usually designated as irreversible, sink reactions\n    always represent a reversible uptake/secretion processes, and act as a\n    metabolite source with no cost to the cell. Sink reactions, also referred\n    to as R_SINK_, are generally used for compounds that are metabolized by\n    the cell but are produced by non-metabolic, un-modeled cellular processes.'\n    Every sink reaction should be annotated with\n    this. Sink reactions differ from exchange reactions in that the metabolites\n    are not removed from the extracellular environment, but from any of the\n    organism's compartments.\n\n    Implementation:\n    Check if each sink reaction has a non-zero \"annotation\"\n    attribute that contains the key \"sbo\" with the associated\n    value being one of the SBO terms above.",
